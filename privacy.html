	<h1>Privacy Policy for Lasertag</h1>
	<p><b>tl;dr, we collect essential information (Meta User ID, IP address, Device ID) on-device.
		We transmit this information only to Meta and Unity services.
		We don't transmit or store information to our own servers.</b></p>
	<p>Lasertag does not transmit any information
	to anyone except for
	<a href="https://www.facebook.com/privacy/policy" target=_"blank">
	Meta</a>,
	<a href="https://unity.com/legal/game-player-and-app-user-privacy-policy" target="_blank">
	Unity</a>,
	and any people you're playing with in the same physical space.</p>

	<p>All Meta Quest apps must typically share some information (such as your User/Device ID, IP address, etc.)
	with Meta. We use the Unity game engine, which may send telemetry data to Unity according to their
	privacy policy.</p>

	<p>The multiplayer networking takes place either on your local network
	or, if you opt-in, through Unity's Relay servers.
	When opting-in to using Unity's Relay servers,
	the software will send some essential information
	(an anonymous per-session ID & your IP address) to Unity.
	</p>

	<p>When you join a multiplayer game, your Meta User ID, Device ID, and IP address
	are shared with other players, with Meta for colocation functionality,
	and optionally with Unity for multiplayer connection functionality.
	We do not transmit any data to anybody else, including to ourselves or our own servers.</p>

	<p>Information about your physical space (point cloud information and more)
	is collected, transmited to, stored, and managed by Meta for colocation functionality.
	We don't handle or have access to that data. Meta allows you to delete
	this data from their servers in your headset's system settings.</p>
