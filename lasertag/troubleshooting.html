				<h1>Troubleshooting</h1>
				<p>
					Lasertag is a work-in-progress game, so some rough edges are
					expected. Meta Quest headsets also have a few quirks that
					can occasionally cause problems.

					<details>
						<summary>Dislocated heads and tracking drift</summary>
						<p>
							This is an issue on Meta's side and the biggest
							issue facing the game :(
						</p>

						<p>
							The Quest headsets are primarily meant for
							single-room indoor use. Their tracking and
							localization systems aren’t tuned for arena-scale
							play, and their 'spatial anchors' system is prone to
							drift. Because of this, headsets won’t stay
							perfectly calibrated to each other over time.
						</p>

						<p>
							I am working on ways to solve this using both
							QR-code-like markers and comparing environment scans
							at different times, but it will be some time before
							I or Meta solve this issue.
						</p>

						<p>
							In the meantime, you can use the
							<b>Recalibrate</b> option in the in-game menu to
							correct drift during play. I also recommend sticking
							to well-lit indoor spaces with lots of contrast and
							detail to help reduce drift issues.
						</p>
					</details>

					<details>
						<summary>Won't connect</summary>
						<p>
							<b
								>Your headsets must be on the same WiFi
								network.</b
							>
							Meta headsets have a habit of disconnecting from
							networks when asleep or switching to other known
							networks in the same space.
						</p>

						<p>
							<b>Some WiFi networks just aren't compatible.</b>
							Office and school networks commonly block devices
							from communicating with each other. If your headsets
							aren’t connecting on the same network, try enabling
							the <b>Relay</b> option in the in-game hosting
							settings. This routes connections through an online
							server instead of connecting headsets directly,
							though it may add some latency.
						</p>
					</details>

					<details>
						<summary>Won't align</summary>
						<p>
							First, make sure they all have a proper internet
							connection. While Lasertag connects over LAN,
							alignment unfortunately relies on Meta's cloud
							services.
						</p>

						<p>
							Make sure each headset gets a good look at its
							surroundings. If only some headsets fail, show them
							around the playspace more and try connecting again.
						</p>

						<p>
							Meta's alignment system isn't the most robust.
							Sometimes you just need to reboot troublesome
							headsets. Meta service outages can also prevent
							alignment from working.
						</p>
					</details>

					<details>
						<summary>'Moved too far!' popup error</summary>
						<p>
							Meta headsets restrict movement, even in mixed
							reality, to a certain radius from the 'origin'
							(which is where you either launched the app or last
							re-centered). This radius is ~20 meters.
						</p>

						<p>
							You can prevent this pop-up by disabling 'physical
							space features' in the settings app.
							<b>Beware these resulting quirks!</b>
						</p>

						<ul>
							<li>
								The system boundary isdangerously disabled in
								all VR apps!
							</li>
							<li>
								Passthrough is disabled in the system home menu.
							</li>
							<li>
								Screen recordings won't capture passthrough.
								You'll just see a black void.
							</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							Once you are done playing Lasertag, or if you wish
							to capture video, make sure to turn this back on!

					</details>

					<details>
						<summary>Black video recordings</summary>
						<p>
							See above. Make sure 'physical space features' are
							enabled when recording video.
						</p>
					</details>

					<details>
						<summary>
							Shooting or seeing people through walls
						</summary>
						<p>
							If you're playing on Quest 3 or 3S, make sure you
							give the app 'spatial data' permission. You may have
							to grant it in system settings. Sometimes headsets
							can't accurately understand your environment due to
							reflective surfaces, light glare, etc.
						</p>

						<p>
							If you're playing on Quest 2 or Pro, these headsets
							unfortunately lack features necessary to understand
							and respond to your environment.
						</p>
					</details>

					<details>
						<summary>
							'Multiple Devices Can't Access This App at the Same
							Time' popup error
						</summary>
						<p>
							Enabling App Sharing on <i>any</i> single headset
							causes this popup on all other headsets linked to
							the same account.
						</p>
						<p>
							You can disable App Sharing even if you don't have
							access physical to the headset here:
