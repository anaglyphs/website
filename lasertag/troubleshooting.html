<h1>Troubleshooting</h1>
<p>Lasertag is a work-in-progress game, so some rough edges are expected.
Meta Quest headsets also have a few quirks that can occasionally cause problems.

<details>
	<summary>Dislocated heads and tracking drift</summary>
	<p>This is an issue on Meta's side and the biggest issue facing the game :(</p>

	<p>The Quest headsets are primarily meant for single-room indoor use.
		Their tracking and localization systems aren’t tuned
		for arena-scale play, and spatial anchors are prone to drift.
		Because of this, headsets won’t stay perfectly calibrated
		to each other over time.</p>

	<p>I am working on ways to solve this using both QR-code-like markers
		and comparing environment scans at different times, but it will
		be some time before I or Meta solve this issue.</p>

	<p>In the meantime, you can use the <b>Recalibrate</b> option
		in the in-game menu to correct drift during play.
		I also recommend sticking to well-lit indoor spaces
		with lots of contrast and detail
		to help reduce drift issues.</p>

	<summary>Won't connect</summary>
	<p><b>Your headsets must be on the same WiFi network.</b>
	Meta headsets have a habit of disconnecting from networks when asleep
	or switching to other known networks in the same space.

	<p><b>Some WiFi networks just aren't compatible.</b>
	Office and school networks commonly block devices
	from communicating with each other.
	If your headsets aren’t connecting on the same network,
	try enabling the <b>Relay</b> option in the in-game hosting settings.
	This routes connections through an online server
	instead of connecting headsets directly,
	though it may add some latency.
</details>

<details>
	<summary>Won't collocate</summary>
	<p>First, make sure they all have a proper internet connection.
	While Lasertag connects over LAN, collocation unfortunately
	relies on Meta's cloud services.

	<p>Make sure each headset gets a good look at its surroundings.
	If only some headsets fail, show them around
	the playspace more and try connecting again.

	<p>Meta's collocation system isn't the most robust.
	Sometimes you just need to reboot troublesome headsets.
	Meta service outages can also prevent collocation from working.

<details>
	<summary>'Moved too far!' popup error</summary>
	<p>Meta headsets restrict movement, even in mixed reality, to a certain
	radius from the 'origin' (which is where you either launched the app
	or last re-centered). This radius is ~20 meters.

	<p>You can prevent this pop-up by disabling 'physical space features' in the settings app.
	<b>Beware these resulting quirks!</b>
	<ul>
		<li>The system boundary isdangerously disabled in all VR apps!
		<li>Passthrough is disabled in the system home menu.
		<li>Screen recordings won't capture passthrough. You'll just see a black void.
	</ul>
	<p>Once you are done playing Lasertag, or if you wish to capture video,
	make sure to turn this back on!

<details>
	<summary>Black video recordings</summary>
	<p>See above. Make sure 'physical space features' are enabled
	when recording video.
</details>

<details>
	<summary>Shooting or seeing people through walls</summary>
	<p>If you're playing on Quest 3 or 3s, make sure you
	give the app 'spatial data' permission. You may have to grant it
	in system settings. Sometimes headsets can't accurately
	understand your environment due to reflective surfaces,
	light glare, etc.

	<p>If you're playing on Quest 2 or Pro, these headsets unfortunately
	lack features necessary to understand and respond to your environment.

<details>
	<summary>'Multiple Devices Can't Access This App at the Same Time' popup error</summary>
	<p>Enabling App Sharing on <i>any</i> single headset
		causes this popup on all other headsets linked to the same account.</p>
	<p>You can disable App Sharing even if you don't have access physical to the headset
		here:
