<h1>How to Play</h1>

<p>Lasertag is still in early development,
	so the experience is fairly minimal for now.

<p><b>We recommend only playing on Quest 3 and 3s.</b>
Quest 2 and Quest Pro don't support room scanning during
gameplay and can't properly occlude virtual objects
behind real-world obstacles. This gives older headset users
a huge advantage unless you're playing in an open space using only
virtual walls for cover.

<p>To start a game, make sure all of your headsets are on the same WiFi network.
Then, have one person press the 'host game' button. Other nearby headsets
should connect automatically. School and office networks may not work.

<p>Once everyone connects, you can start shooting at each other!
<b>Only headshots count!</b>

<p>Use the Objects Menu to place team bases, capture points, and walls,
or to select your weapon. After placing both red and blue bases,
you can start a team deathmatch that lasts 3 minutes.
Future updates will expand the match system with more
game modes, customization options, and weapons.
