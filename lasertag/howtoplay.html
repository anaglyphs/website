				<h1>How to Play</h1>

				<p>
					Lasertag is still in early development, so the experience is
					fairly minimal for now.
				</p>

				<p>
					<b>We recommend only playing on Quest 3 and 3s.</b> Quest 2
					and Quest Pro don't support room scanning during gameplay
					and can't properly occlude virtual objects behind real-world
					obstacles. This gives older headset users a huge advantage
					unless you're playing in an open space using only virtual
					walls for cover.
				</p>

				<p>
					To start a game, make sure all of your headsets are on the
					same WiFi network. Then, have one person press the 'host
					game' button. Other nearby headsets should connect
					automatically. School and office networks may not work.
				</p>

				<p>
					Once everyone connects, you can start shooting at each
					other! <b>Only headshots count!</b>
				</p>

				<p>
					Use the Objects Menu to place team bases, capture points,
					and walls, or to select your weapon. After placing both red
					and blue bases, you can start a team deathmatch that lasts 3
					minutes. Future updates will expand the match system with
					more game modes, customization options, and weapons.
